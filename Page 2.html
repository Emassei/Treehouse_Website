		<h1>An age that prides itself</h1>
		<p>One must spy out and elicit those hungers. For there is no real education that does not respond to felt need; anything else acquired 
		is trifling display. What each generation is can be best discovered in its 
		relation to the permanent concerns of mankind. This in turn can best be 
		discovered in each generation's tastes, amusements, and especially angers 
		(this is above all true in an age that prides itself on calm self-awareness). 
		Particularly revealing are the various impostors whose business it is to 
		appeal to the young.

		 These culture peddlers have the strongest of motives 
		for finding out the appetites of the young--so they are useful guides into 
		the labyrinths of the spirit of the times.
		The teacher's standpoint is not arbitrary. It is neither simply depen- 
		dent on what students think they want or happen to be in this place or 
		time, nor is it imposed on him by the demands of a particular society or 
		the vagaries of the market.
		</p>
		<p>
		A liberal education means precisely helping students to pose this 
		question to themselves, to become aware that the answer is neither obvi- 
		ous nor simply unavailable, and that there is no serious life in which this 
		question is not a continuous concern. Despite all the efforts to pervert it 
		(a few of which will be discussed in this book), the question that every 
		young person asks, "Who am I?," the powerful urge to follow the Delphic 
		command, "Know thyself," which is born in each of us, means in the first 
		place "What is man?" And in our chronic lack of certainty, this comes 
		down to knowing the altemative answers and thinking about them. Lib- 
		eral education provides access to these alternatives, many of which go 
		against the grain of our nature or our times.
