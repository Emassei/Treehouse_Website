The soul has to find and hold its ground against 
hostile forces, sometimes embodied in ideas which frequently deny its very 
existence, and which indeed often seem to be trying to annul it altogether. 
Romantic poets and other edifying theorists of the nineteenth cen-

human beings, inducing them to view the world differently, converting 
them from fixed modes of experience, is ambition enough, if one must 
offer a purposive account of the artist's proiect. What makes that proiect 
singularly difficult is the disheartening expansion of trained ignorance and 
bad thought.
